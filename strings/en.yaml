What the presenter should do? They should klick <b>«View word»</b> and describe the word he saw without saying the actual word in 5 minutes. If they didn't like to describe that word, they can click <b>«Change word»</b> to get another word.\n\n

What players should do? They should try to think of the word that the presenter is talking about and say it.\n\n

Any player who says the correct word, gets a score.
